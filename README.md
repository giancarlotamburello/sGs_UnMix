This application streamlines spatial prediction workflows and minimizes subjectivity in statistical analysis, making it accessible to the entire geoscience community. The sGs Web App (available online at shiny.bo.ingv.it:8787) is developed using the Shiny package for R Studio and is structured into four primary panels. These panels facilitate tasks such as data loading and coordinate projection, separation of data sources and definition of thresholds, modeling spatial continuity through variograms, and performing sequential Gaussian simulation (sGs) for spatial prediction. The app features automated variogram fitting and data unmixing to reduce user bias and improve reproducibility. Predicted value heat maps, overlaid on satellite or geographic map layers, dynamically refresh based on input values, allowing for rapid visualization of spatial patterns and anomalies. This web app can serve as a standardized method for estimating volcanic volatile fluxes (e.g., soil CO2 emissions) both locally and globally, and
